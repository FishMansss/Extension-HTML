     When He came to build, put the buffalo on Mother Earth, all the rest would kill another, eat one another.<br><br> “But the buffalo,” He said to himself, “I should put on Mother Earth, people similar to me, so they can make use of the buffalo.”<br> This natural area had natural boundaries.<br><br> To the South was the Yellowstone River and to the West was the Rocky Mountains, as far North as the Saskatchewan River, East to the Cyprus Hills.<br><br> Now He knew all the areas and when He put the buffalo on Mother Earth, He built, He put everything in twos, the male and female.<br><br> So the buffalo had a male and a female.<br><br> And to the same area where he molded the different animals, He took clay, he molded it into a person.<br><br> He opened its mouth and blew into it.
