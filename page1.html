        The Story of Napi the Trickster. A Blackfoot Legend.<br> I want to tell an old history about Napi.<br> Napi chose a large area of land, East of the Rockies.<br> He put on there, all the different animals that walk on mother Earth, the water animals, the ones that fly.<br> He built the rivers and landmarks in this area and they were all named in Blackfoot.
